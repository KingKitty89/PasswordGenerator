## **Description**

For this project I was given an HTML file and a corresponding CSS style sheet that had the basic set up for a password generator. I then created a Javascript file to add functionality to it. The password generator creates a password based on the users input. The user will enter the amount of characters they would like their password to be. The password is required to have at least 8 characters but no more than 128 characters in it. The password must have at least one selection for either uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and or numbers. The generator will take the users input and create a strong password that provides greater security for the user.
